h Christmas, a time of joy and cheer,
A season to gather near and hold dear.
The trees stand tall, their branches bare,
As snowflakes fall, like diamonds in the air.

The stockings hang by the chimney with care,
Waiting for Santa, with gifts to share.
The children dream of toys and treats galore,
While carolers sing, on our doorstep once more.

The tree is lit, its lights aglow,
A symbol of hope, in this winter's snow.
The fireplace crackles, with warmth and light,
As families gather, through the night.

Oh Christmas, you bring us together,
In love and laughter, we find each other.
A time of giving, a time of peace,
A time to cherish, a time to release.
